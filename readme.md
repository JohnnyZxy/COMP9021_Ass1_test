# 9021_test_session

## Use test script
If you need to test please perform the following steps
First open `put_your_code_here/knights_and_knaves.py`. Change the file to the program you need to test.

Switch the working directory to the folder and execute `python3 start_test.py`, all test cases in `test_cases` will be executed. The results will be output to `out_put`

## Upload test cases
If you want to contribute something to the testing, please don't hesitate to upload the test document you designed and we will run it together and compare the output results.

Just place the test txt file in the `test_cases` folder. Please give it a unique name, such as `Maka314_case1.txt`.

If you don’t know yet, you can get an achievement by pulling the code twice on github.😉

## important hint❗
Don’t forget to check your gitignore. Uploading your own work is not the result we want.
