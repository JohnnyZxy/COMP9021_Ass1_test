Suppose you visited the island of Knights and Knaves. 
You come across two of the inhabitants lazily lying in the sun.
You met a group of 6 islanders. 
Their names were Sirs Zoro, Beatrix, Arthur, Michelle, Tracy and Xan. 

Sir Beatrix said:"Sir Zoro is a Knight."
Sir Zoro said:"Sir Arthur is a Knave."
Sir Arthur said: "Sir Beatrix is a Knave."
Sir Tracy said: "Sir Xan is a Knight."
Sir Michelle said: "Sir Tracy is a Knight."
Sir Xan said:" Sir Michelle is a Knight."
Sir Beatrix said: "Sir Xan is a Knave."
Sir Beatrix added:"I am a Knight."
