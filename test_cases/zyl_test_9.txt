Yesterday, I was playing League of Legends. 
Sir Darius said: "I am a Knight."
Sir Lee helped Sir Darius get first blood. 
Sir Garen said: "Darius or Lee is Knave!"
Sir Jinx got unhappy at the bot lane, "exactly one of Garen, Darius
 and Riven is a Knave!"
Sir Lee added:"At least one of us is a Knight."
Sir Riven won lane , 
so he was happy and said, "Sir Garen is a Knight."
What do you think?
