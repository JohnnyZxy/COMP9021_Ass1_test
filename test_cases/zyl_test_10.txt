Yesterday, I was playing League of Legends. 
Sir Darius said: "At least one of us is a Knight."
Sir Garen said:"At most one of Jinx, Lee or Teemo is a Knight!"
Sir Jinx said,"exactly one of Garen, Darius and Riven is a Knave."
Sir Lee said: "All of us are Knights."
Sir Riven said:"I am a Knight."
Sir Teemo said, "Sir Darius is a Knight."
Sir Darius said:"Garen or Jinx is a Knight."
Sir Lee agreed:"Garen and Riven are Knaves."
What do you think?
