Yesterday, I was playing League of Legends. 
Sir Darius said: "At least one of us is a Knight."
Sirs Jinx and Teemo won bot lane with the help from Sir Lee. 
Sir Lee said, "at least one of Jinx and Teemo is a Knight."
Sir Garen said:"At most one of Jinx, Lee or Teemo is a Knight!"
Sir Lee disagreed: "I am a Knave."
Sir Darius got ganked, and he 
complained:"Sir Lee is a Knight."
Sir Xin laughed:"Sir Darius is a Knave!"
Sir Jinx said,"exactly one of Garen, Darius and Riven is a Knave."
Sir Teemo said, "Sir Darius is a Knight."
Sir Darius said:"Garen or Jinx is a Knight."
Sir Lee agreed:"Garen and Riven are Knaves."
What do you think?
