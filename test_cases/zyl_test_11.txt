Yesterday, I was playing League of Legends. 
Sir Darius said: "At least one of us is a Knight."
Sirs Jinx and Teemo won bot Sir lane with the help from Sir Lee. 
Sir Lee said, "at least one of Sir Jinx and Sir Teemo is a Knight."
Sir Garen said:"At most one of Sir Jinx, Sir Lee or Sir Teemo is a Knight!"
Sir Lee disagreed: "I am a Knave."
Sir Darius got ganked, and he 
complained:"Sir Lee is a Knight."
Sir Xin laughed:"Sir Darius is a Knave!"
Sir Jinx said,"exactly one of Sir Garen, Sir Darius and Sir Riven is a Knave."
Sir Teemo said, "Sir Darius is a Knight."
Sir Darius said:"Sir Garen or Sir Jinx is a Knight."
Sir Lee agreed:"Sir Garen and Sir Riven are Knaves."
What do you think?
