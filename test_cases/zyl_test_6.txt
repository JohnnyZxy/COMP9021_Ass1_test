Yesterday, I visited Sirs Ashe and Darius. I asked Sir Ashe 
who he was, and he answered impatiently: 
"Exactly one of Darius and Jhin is a Knight."
 Then I met Sir Garen who introduced me to his wife
and told me: "Ashe or Jhin is a Knave."
 "Darius, Ashe and Jhin are Knights," whispered Sir Garen. 
Should I trust them?
